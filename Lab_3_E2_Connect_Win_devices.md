# Module 6 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Connect Windows devices to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to connect log data from the many data sources in your organization. The next source of data are Windows virtual machines inside and outside of Azure, like On-Premises environments or other Public Clouds.


### Task 1: Create a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure

In this task, you will create a Windows virtual machine in Azure.

1. Login to WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

1. In the Edge browser, navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy, and paste in the **Tenant Email** account provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy, and paste in the **Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

1. Select **+ Create a Resource**. **Hint:** If you were already in the Azure Portal, you might need to select *Microsoft Azure* from the top bar to go Home.

1. In the **Search services and marketplace** box, enter *Windows 10* and select **Microsoft Window 10** from the drop-down list.

1. Open the *Plan* drop-down list and select **Windows 10 Enterprise, version 20H2**. Select **Start with a pre-set configuration** to continue.

1. Select **Dev/Test** and then select **Continue to create a VM**.

1. Select **Create new** for *Resource group*, enter RG-AZWIN01 as Name and select **OK**.

    >**Note:** This will be a new resource group for tracking purposes. 

1. In *Virtual machine name*, enter AZWIN01.

1. Set the *Region* to the appropriate region for your area. The appropriate region will default.

1. Scroll down and review the *Size* for the virtual machine. If it appears empty, select **See all sizes**, choose **B2ms** and click **Select**.

1. Enter a *Username* of your choosing. **Hint:** Avoid reserved words like admin or root.

1. Enter a *Password* of your choosing. **Hint:** It might be easier to re-use your tenant password. It can be found in the resources tab.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the checkbox below *Licensing* to confirm you have the eligible license.

1. Select **Review + create** and wait until the validation is passed.

1. Select **Create**. Wait for the Resource to be created, this may take a few minutes.


### Task 2: Connect an Azure Windows virtual machine

In this task, you will connect an Azure Windows virtual machine to Microsoft Sentinel.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Sentinel*, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier.

1. From the Data Connectors Tab, search for the **Security Events via Legacy Agent** connector and select it from the list.

1. Select the **AZWIN01** virtual machine that you just created in the previous task, and then select **Connect**. Wait until the "Status" shows *This workspace*.

1. Close the window by selecting the 'x'. In the *Configuration* section, under "2. Select which events to stream", select **All Events**, then select **Apply Changes**.


### Task 3: Connect a non-Azure Windows Machine

In this task, you will connect a non-Azure Windows virtual machine to Microsoft Sentinel.

>**Important:** The next steps are done in a different machine than the one you were previously working. Look for the Virtual Machine name references.

1. Login to WIN2 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

1. Open the Microsoft Edge browser.

1. Open a browser and log into the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com with the credentials you have been using in the previous labs.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure Portal, type *Sentinel*, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select **Download & install agent for non-Azure Windows machines**. 

    >**Note:** Your Log Analytics workspace should show *2 Windows computers connected*. This corresponds to WINServer and AZWIN01 virtual machines connected earlier.

1. Select the link for **Download Windows Agent (64 bit)**.

1. Select **Open file** under the *MMASetup-AMD64.exe* file that was downloaded and select **Yes** to allow the executable to run in the User Account Control window that appears.

1. Select **Next** on the welcome dialog, select **I Agree** to the "Microsoft Software License Terms" page and **Next** on the Destination prompt to accept the default path.

1. In the browser with Microsoft Sentinel open, copy the **Workspace ID** from the Agents Management page and paste into the Workspace ID in the dialog. 

1. In the browser with Microsoft Sentinel open, copy the **Primary key** from the Agents Management page and paste into the Workspace key in the dialog. 

1. Select **Next** to save the configuration.

1. Select **Next** on the Microsoft Update page.

1. Then select **Install**. Wait for the Microsoft Monitoring Agent setup to finish.

1. When complete, select **Finish**.


### Task 4: Install and collect Sysmon logs

In this task, you will install and collect Sysmon logs.

>**Note:** The following instructions will install Sysmon with the default configuration. You should research community-based configurations for Sysmon to be used on production machines.
