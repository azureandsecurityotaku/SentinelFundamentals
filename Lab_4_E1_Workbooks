# Lab 4 - Exercise 1 - Create workbooks

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. Once you have connected your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, you can visualize and monitor the data using the Microsoft Sentinel adoption of Azure Monitor Workbooks, which provides versatility in creating custom dashboards. 

Microsoft Sentinel allows you to create custom workbooks across your data, and also comes with built-in workbook templates to allow you to quickly gain insights across your data as soon as you connect a data source.
